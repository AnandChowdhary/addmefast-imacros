# addmefast-imacros
An iMacros script for getting Addmefast points using your Instagram account.

1. Log in to instagram.com
2. Log in to addmefast.com
3. Run this script using the iMacros add-on (preferably in Firefox)

This script will automatically follow accounts on Instagram and get you points in your Addmefast account.

## ⚠️ Archive Notice

Back in the old days, digital marketing for me meant irrelevant followers and likes. This "black hat" script would automate your browser to like people's photos on Instagram in return for AddMeFast points, and use those points to get followers. This is not only against their Terms of Service, but also a horrible way to grow reach. Please don't use this.
